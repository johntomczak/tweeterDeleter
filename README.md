I like how some people (mainly the Bruenigs come to mind) have their tweets - own posts, retweets, replies to others - delete themselves after 24 hours.

Most of the services that do this are either a) free and limited or b) paid and maybe-sufficient. So, I am going to make my own, for free, and for practice.

Feel free to fork and/or reach out with thoughts you have.

I will have to host it on my AWS server, which also has my instapaper auto-sorter, set with a cronjob to run every hour. I get the feeling that eventually I am going to have a lot of these kinds of services on there.
